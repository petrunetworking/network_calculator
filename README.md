Hello, I present to you the application on which I am working intensively The application offers you information about IP-addresses and numerical conversions, subnet calculation, VLSM calculation and in the future IPv6 Information and Conversion from IPv4 to IPv6
In the first Tab there is information about IP Information, Prefix Mask conversion, mask-wildcard conversion
In the second tab is Numeric conversion binary decimal hexadecimal and IP-addresses binary conversion
in the Third Tab is the division of the network into subnets of the same size
or it is also called FLSM Calculation
and already in the fourth VLSM Calculation tab
all examples are in example photo app
the application can also export the subnet in an excel file,I have attached 2 files that show how the application exports the subnet in excel
